# Unity-A-Star-Test
 

# IMPORTANT! CODE IS REALLY REALLY NOT OPTIMIZED !!!! AS THIS IS A TEST TO SEE IF I UNDERSTAND A*.


The code is not optimized as I was just testing my knowledge on A*, if I could do it. I purposefully did not optimzie the code and did things unoptimizely in order to complete this test quicker. 



As mentioned, this project was done quickly, only took 1-2 hours and is my first time ever implementing an A* algorithm from scratch. 

In the future, I strive to re-do this project and optimzie it.
